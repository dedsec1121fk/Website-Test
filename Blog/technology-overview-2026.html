      <h2>1) Overview</h2>
      <p>Technology is one of those words we use every day without considering its full scope. In a strict sense, the term refers to the application of scientific knowledge to practical aims【463764307900805†L84-L91】. This definition comes from Encyclopædia Britannica and emphasises two important ingredients: knowledge and purpose. Technology is not just knowledge for its own sake; it is knowledge put to work to solve problems, achieve goals or extend human capabilities. The word itself derives from the Greek <em>technē</em> (art, craft) and <em>logos</em> (word, discourse), underscoring that technology is about the thoughtful making of things【463764307900805†L84-L91】.</p>
      <p>Under that broad definition, technology includes everything from simple stone tools to sophisticated quantum computers. It is a human activity tied to survival and improvement. When early humans began chipping flint to create sharper edges, they were engaging in technology. When farmers domesticated plants and animals, they were applying biological knowledge to feed more people. Today, when engineers design semiconductors or scientists develop mRNA vaccines, they are practising technology. The unifying theme is the deliberate use of knowledge about the world to design, build and deploy tools and systems.</p>
      <p>Because technology is so broad, it touches every aspect of modern life. The devices we carry, the infrastructure that delivers power and water, the satellites that send signals across continents and the algorithms that curate information online are all technologies. Their pervasiveness makes it easy to forget that each invention is the result of human choices and trade‑offs. Throughout this article we explore how technology evolved, why it matters and what challenges it raises. Understanding these dimensions helps us become more responsible creators and consumers of technology.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="history">
      <h2>2) Historical evolution</h2>
      <p>The history of technology is the history of human civilisation. Stone Age technologies such as fire and flint knapping allowed early humans to cook food, stay warm and defend themselves. The Agricultural Revolution, beginning around 10 000 BCE, introduced domesticated crops and livestock, irrigation and permanent settlements. This transformation supported larger populations and led to the first cities. Metalworking followed: copper, bronze and iron tools improved durability and efficiency. Each material advanced craft and war, enabling new social structures.</p>
      <p>The Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries is often cited as a turning point. Steam engines, mechanised looms and railways dramatically increased production and transportation capacity. Energy moved from human and animal labour to coal and later oil. These machines were based on scientific principles and triggered a cascade of social changes, including urbanisation, factory work and the rise of capitalist economies. In the 20th century electricity, telecommunications, mass production, aviation and nuclear technology reshaped everyday life. The digital revolution of the late 20th and early 21st centuries introduced microprocessors, personal computers, the internet and mobile devices, creating an interconnected world where information flows almost instantly.</p>
      <p>While this timeline reads as a story of progress, it is also marked by missteps and consequences. Technologies such as fossil fuel extraction contributed to climate change. Industrial chemical production led to pollution and health problems. Weapons technologies have made wars deadlier. Understanding history means recognising both the leaps forward and the costs that accompanied them. Today’s debates about artificial intelligence, biotechnology and climate engineering are part of this ongoing historical narrative.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="importance">
      <h2>3) Importance &amp; applications</h2>
      <p>Technology matters because it shapes what societies can do and how people live. Modern medicine depends on technologies from microscopes and imaging devices to antibiotics and vaccines. Transportation uses engines, composite materials and navigation systems to move billions of people and goods each day. Communication technologies—from the printing press to the smartphone—have expanded literacy and connected communities. Information technology underpins finance, education, entertainment and governance.</p>
      <p>Technologies also influence power dynamics. Nations invest heavily in military technology to secure borders, deter threats and project influence. Economic competitiveness hinges on the ability to innovate and adopt new technologies quickly. At the personal level, access to digital technologies can affect education and job opportunities. The importance of technology is therefore not neutral; it interacts with politics, economics and culture. Inclusive access can improve wellbeing, while unequal access can exacerbate inequality.</p>
      <p>In the 21st century, the convergence of disciplines is particularly notable. Biotechnology merges biology and engineering to create gene‑editing tools, synthetic organisms and personalised medicine. Artificial intelligence (AI) uses algorithms and computing power to perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence. Nanotechnology works at the scale of atoms and molecules to develop new materials. These applications hold great promise but also raise ethical questions about privacy, autonomy and safety.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="challenges">
      <h2>4) Challenges and criticism</h2>
      <p>No technology is purely benign. The same scientific knowledge that produces life‑saving drugs can produce biological weapons. Digital platforms facilitate social connection but can also spread misinformation and surveillance. Industrial production yields goods but also emits greenhouse gases and generates waste. These realities fuel criticism that technology advances faster than our ability to manage its impacts. Philosophers of technology caution against technological determinism—the belief that technology develops according to its own logic independent of human agency. In reality, human choices, politics and economics shape which technologies are developed and how they are used.</p>
      <p>Another challenge is sustainability. Many modern technologies rely on finite resources such as rare earth metals or fossil fuels. Extraction and processing of these materials can damage ecosystems and exploit workers. Balancing technological advancement with ecological stewardship is one of the defining issues of our era. Additionally, the speed of technological change can create social disruption: automation threatens certain jobs; social media alters how we interact; and constant connectivity blurs boundaries between work and rest.</p>
      <p>Critics also raise concerns about the concentration of technological power. A handful of corporations and governments control critical infrastructure, data flows and platforms. This concentration can limit competition, undermine privacy and influence public discourse. Democratising technology—ensuring that its benefits and decisions are broadly shared—is therefore an important counterbalance to unrestrained innovation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="future">
      <h2>5) Future directions</h2>
      <p>Looking ahead, technology will continue to evolve in complex ways. AI and machine learning are poised to automate more cognitive tasks, raising questions about the future of work, creativity and decision‑making. Renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind and battery storage are central to climate mitigation. Quantum computing may enable new forms of simulation and encryption. Biotechnology could extend human lifespans and even alter species. Space technology is opening commercial access to orbit and beyond.</p>
      <p>The future is not predetermined. It will depend on the choices societies make about research funding, regulation, education and ethics. Public engagement is crucial: communities should have a voice in deciding which problems technology should address and which risks are acceptable. Integrating diverse perspectives can help steer innovation toward social good rather than narrow profit motives. Educating ourselves about the history, meaning and consequences of technology empowers us to participate in these discussions.</p>
      <p>Finally, the concept of appropriate technology—technology tailored to the context and needs of a community—reminds us that small‑scale, low‑tech solutions can be as transformative as cutting‑edge inventions. Solar lamps replacing kerosene in remote villages, rainwater harvesting systems in arid regions and open‑source software for local governments exemplify technology serving human wellbeing. The future of technology should not be a race to the most sophisticated device but a quest for innovations that enhance human flourishing.</p>
