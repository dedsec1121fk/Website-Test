    <div class="content-section" id="overview">
      <h2>1) Overview</h2>
      <p>The Science Council defines science as the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence【959874904689941†L114-L129】. This definition emphasises both the process (systematic enquiry) and the product (reliable knowledge). Science is not merely a collection of facts but a disciplined approach to discovering how the universe works.</p>
      <p>The scientific method involves several key components. Objective observation means recording phenomena without bias. Evidence gathered through observation and measurement is analysed critically. Experiments test hypotheses under controlled conditions, and results must be repeatable by others【959874904689941†L114-L129】. Inductive reasoning is used to derive general principles from specific data. Peer review and publication allow the wider community to scrutinise findings. Over time, theories may be refined, challenged or replaced as new evidence emerges.</p>
      <p>Science covers both natural and social domains. Natural sciences study the physical world—physics, chemistry, earth sciences, astronomy—while social sciences explore human behaviour and societies—psychology, sociology, economics. Applied sciences such as engineering and medicine use scientific knowledge to solve practical problems. The boundaries between these areas are porous; insights from one field often inform another.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="history">
      <h2>2) Historical evolution</h2>
      <p>Scientific inquiry can be traced back to ancient civilisations. Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Hippocrates pursued rational explanations of nature, laying foundations for later systematic study. In the Islamic Golden Age, scholars such as Alhazen developed experimental methods and preserved and expanded classical knowledge. During the Renaissance, figures like Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler challenged geocentric models and advanced mechanics and astronomy. The Scientific Revolution in the 17th century formalised the experimental method through pioneers like Francis Bacon and Isaac Newton.</p>
      <p>The 19th and 20th centuries saw tremendous expansion. Darwin’s theory of evolution unified biology; Mendeleev organised chemical elements into the periodic table; Einstein’s theories of relativity reshaped physics; and quantum mechanics described behaviour at atomic scales. The rise of statistics and computation enabled new disciplines, from genetics to climate science. Science became institutionalised in universities, research institutes and professional societies.</p>
      <p>As science advanced, it also became intertwined with technology, industry and policy. The development of electricity, vaccines, antibiotics, semiconductor electronics and the internet transformed economies and daily life. Scientific research often received state funding and served national interests (e.g., space exploration, nuclear programs). Awareness of the social responsibilities and ethical implications of scientific work grew alongside its power.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="importance">
      <h2>3) Importance &amp; applications</h2>
      <p>Science matters because it provides reliable knowledge that improves human well‑being. Medical science has reduced mortality through vaccines, antibiotics and surgical techniques. Agricultural science has increased food production through crop breeding, soil science and pest control. Earth sciences inform disaster preparedness and resource management. Social sciences guide public policy on education, health and economics.</p>
      <p>Beyond practical applications, science fosters critical thinking and curiosity. Understanding the scale of the universe, the age of Earth, the diversity of life and the complexity of ecosystems inspires awe and humility. Scientific literacy enables citizens to evaluate claims about climate change, health interventions or technological risks. In democratic societies, informed debate on science-related issues helps balance benefits and harms.</p>
      <p>Science also has economic implications. Research and development drive innovation, create jobs and enhance competitiveness. Universities and startups translate scientific discoveries into products and services. Countries that invest in science education and infrastructure often reap long‑term benefits. However, unequal access to science education and participation can perpetuate inequities; efforts to broaden inclusion are ongoing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="challenges">
      <h2>4) Challenges and criticism</h2>
      <p>Science is not infallible. Scientists are human; they can make mistakes, succumb to biases or pursue self‑interest. Replication crises in psychology and biomedicine have revealed that some published findings cannot be reproduced. Publication pressure and funding competition may encourage hype or discourage negative results. Peer review, though essential, can be influenced by status and groupthink.</p>
      <p>Another challenge is the misuse of science. Pseudoscience—claims presented as scientific without adherence to the method—can mislead the public. Political actors may cherry‑pick or distort data to support agendas. Corporations sometimes fund research to cast doubt on established science (e.g., tobacco, climate change). Addressing these issues requires transparency, open data, ethical guidelines and public engagement.</p>
      <p>There are also philosophical critiques. Some argue that science cannot answer all questions—values, meaning and aesthetics lie outside its scope. Others caution against scientism, the belief that science is the only valid way of knowing. Respecting the autonomy of other forms of knowledge, such as the arts and humanities, while recognising science’s unique strengths, is part of a balanced worldview.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="future">
      <h2>5) Future directions</h2>
      <p>The future of science will be shaped by technological advances and social priorities. Big data and artificial intelligence enable analysis of complex systems—from genomics to climate models—but also raise issues of privacy and algorithmic bias. Open science movements advocate for sharing data, code and publications, increasing transparency and collaboration. Interdisciplinary research is growing as global challenges (climate change, pandemics, inequality) require integrated approaches.</p>
      <p>Diversity and inclusion are critical. Historically underrepresented groups (women, minorities, researchers from developing countries) must have equitable access to scientific careers and resources. New funding models, citizen science initiatives and partnerships with indigenous communities can democratise research. Ethical frameworks will be vital as fields like gene editing, AI and geoengineering pose profound questions about what we should do with our capabilities.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, science is an ongoing conversation between humanity and nature. Its methods allow us to refine our understanding and build on past knowledge. By appreciating both the power and limitations of science, we can harness it responsibly to address pressing problems and expand human knowledge for generations to come.</p>
