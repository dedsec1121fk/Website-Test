      <h2>1) Overview &amp; indicators</h2>
      <p>Corruption generally refers to the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. It can take many forms—bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, fraud—and can occur in public or private institutions. In Greece, corruption has long been perceived as a structural problem affecting governance and economic performance. Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which ranks countries by perceived levels of public sector corruption, gives Greece a score of 49 out of 100 and ranks it 59th out of 180 countries【254522541323936†L90-L111】. A higher score indicates less corruption, so a score below 50 suggests significant room for improvement. Transparency International notes that Greece’s score has not changed compared with the previous year, indicating stagnation in anti‑corruption efforts【254522541323936†L90-L111】.</p>
      <p>Other sources provide similar assessments. The WorldData CPI for 2024 reports that Greece scored 51 points and ranked 61st, reflecting an unchanged level of corruption compared with the previous year【842913795517444†L34-L64】. The index emphasises that democratically governed, higher‑income countries tend to exhibit lower levels of corruption, whereas countries with political patronage, social instability or weak institutions show higher levels【842913795517444†L34-L64】. These indicators place Greece roughly in the middle of global rankings—better than some of its neighbours but worse than most northern European states. They also underscore that progress against corruption must be sustained to improve the country’s international standing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="causes">
      <h2>2) Causes &amp; drivers</h2>
      <p>Several intertwined factors help explain why corruption persists in Greece. Historically, clientelism—a system in which political support is exchanged for favours—has shaped Greek politics. Public sector jobs and contracts were often distributed based on personal connections rather than merit, creating expectations of reciprocity. Bureaucratic complexity and opaque regulations can also foster corruption by increasing opportunities for officials to demand bribes for permits or services. WorldData notes that political and cultural reasons, coupled with ineffective law enforcement, contribute to corruption in Greece【842913795517444†L34-L64】. In other words, when people lack confidence that the rules will be applied fairly, they may be more inclined to circumvent them.</p>
      <p>The economic crisis that began in 2009 exposed weaknesses in governance. Austerity measures, cuts in public sector salaries and hiring freezes may have incentivised officials to seek informal payments. Meanwhile, tax evasion and informal economies thrived, partly because of complex tax laws and distrust in state institutions. Inadequate auditing and internal controls allowed fraud and mismanagement to go undetected. The Organisation for Economic Co‑operation and Development (OECD) notes that although Greek regulations require public bodies to prepare risk registers documenting corruption and fraud risks, many internal audit units are not staffed according to legal requirements and risk assessments are inconsistent【417598924689725†L5548-L5559】.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="impact">
      <h2>3) Impact &amp; consequences</h2>
      <p>Corruption erodes trust in institutions and undermines democratic legitimacy. When citizens believe that rules can be bent for a price, they are less likely to comply with laws voluntarily. Corruption also distorts public spending. Funds that should go toward education, healthcare or infrastructure may be siphoned off through inflated contracts or bogus projects. This misallocation of resources hampers economic growth and contributes to inequality. In Greece, corruption has been cited as one factor contributing to the sovereign debt crisis, as it weakened tax collection and increased the cost of public projects.</p>
      <p>Beyond direct financial losses, corruption deters investment and innovation. Foreign investors may hesitate to enter markets perceived as corrupt because of the unpredictability of costs and the risk of legal liability. Businesses face higher transaction costs when bribes become a prerequisite for obtaining licenses or winning tenders. Socially, corruption breeds cynicism and can encourage talented young people to emigrate, seeking opportunities in countries with more transparent systems. The persistence of corruption thus exacerbates the “brain drain” and slows societal renewal.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="reforms">
      <h2>4) Reforms &amp; initiatives</h2>
      <p>Despite these challenges, Greece has undertaken significant anti‑corruption reforms, particularly after the financial crisis. In 2011 the country established the National Transparency Authority (EAD) by merging several audit and inspection bodies. The EAD is mandated to coordinate anti‑corruption policies, conduct inspections and promote transparency across the public sector. Greece also adopted a National Anti‑Corruption Plan outlining measures such as digitalising public services to reduce face‑to‑face interactions (and thus opportunities for bribes) and enhancing whistle‑blower protections.  </p>
      <p>At the procedural level, Greece has been implementing risk management frameworks aligned with OECD recommendations. These frameworks require public bodies to maintain risk registers identifying corruption and fraud risks【417598924689725†L5548-L5559】. However, as the OECD notes, implementation remains uneven because many internal audit units lack sufficient staff and expertise【417598924689725†L5548-L5559】. EU institutions and international lenders have also pushed for reforms in public procurement, tax administration and judiciary efficiency. Civil society organisations and investigative journalists play an important role in exposing corruption and advocating for accountability.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-section" id="future">
      <h2>5) Future prospects</h2>
      <p>Reducing corruption in Greece will likely require sustained political will, cultural change and institutional strengthening. Education campaigns can help build a culture of integrity from school age, while transparent e‑government platforms can reduce opportunities for bribery. Simplifying regulations and reducing discretion in public administration can close avenues for rent‑seeking. Strengthening auditing bodies, fully staffing internal audit units and ensuring that risk assessments are conducted consistently across ministries will be essential to implement the OECD’s recommendations【417598924689725†L5548-L5559】.</p>
      <p>At the broader level, economic recovery and social cohesion are vital. When citizens perceive that the system is fair and provides opportunities, they are less likely to resort to corruption. International cooperation through EU mechanisms, peer reviews and knowledge exchange can support reforms and share best practices. Greece’s progress on the CPI over the next decade will depend on whether these efforts translate into real changes in the lived experiences of citizens and businesses. As transparency increases and accountability mechanisms strengthen, trust can be rebuilt, ultimately benefiting the country’s democracy and economic resilience.</p>
